oops : object oriented programming system


--> class
-> object
-> inheritance 
-> polymorphism
-> encapsulation
-> Abstarction 
-> Aggregation

=============================================

1) class : class is a user definde data type which is represented by class keyword.

class which is contain data member and member function in single entity.


syntax:  

class  <classname>:
    data member
    member function



2) object : object is an instance of class .which is use to access properties of class.
    we can say that object is a variable of class


    syntax: 

    <classname> objname;


    e.g. whatsapp group(class)

        member :(data member)

        admin: (object) -  object can add - remove members

        messaging - video calling - (membr function or methods)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
__init__() : init function which is represent as a magic method or dunder method 
    (double underscore method)

    __init__ which is represented as a constructor in class

    which is invoke automatically whenever we create object of  class

self : self is a parameter which is represented current class properties.


==================================================================

difference beetween function and methods



function which is represent by def keyword and methods are represente by def keywords


function are independent , and methods are dependent


function which define outside the class


methods which is defined inside the class


============================================================
3) inheritance : one class derive propertiers of another class its called inheritance
     inheritance provide reusablity of code

    using of inheritance we can reduce our code


    we can save developement time


    there is 5 type of inheritance :

    1) single 
    2) multiple 
    3)multilevel
    4)hirarchical
    5)hybrid

    ----------------------------------------------------
    1)single inheritance:
            class A
            |
            V 
            class B 

            class A is super class ,base class or parent class.

    2)multilvel inheritance
            class A 
            |
            V 
            class B 
            |
            V 
            class C
    3) multiple inheritance
    two different class inherited by single class
      class A                         class B 
      |                                 |
      ----------------------------------
                    |
                    V 
                    class C 

    4) hierarchical inheritance 
     one parent classd have mote than one child class

                     Class A 
                      | 
        ---------------------------------
        |                              |
        class B                      class C
    5) hybrid inheritance :
            combination of hierarchical and multiple inheritance
            Class A 
                      | 
        ---------------------------------
        |                              |
        class B                      class C
        |
        V 
        class D
