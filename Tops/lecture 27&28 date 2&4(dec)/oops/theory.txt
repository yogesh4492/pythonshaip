oops : object oriented programming system


-> class
-> object
-> inheritance 
-> polymorphism
-> encapsulation
-> Abstarction 
-> Aggregation

=============================================

1) class : class is a user definde data type which is represented by class keyword.

class which is contain data member and member function in single entity.


syntax:  

class  <classname>:
    data member
    member function



2) object : object is an instance of class .which is use to access properties of class.
    we can say that object is a variable of class


    syntax: 

    <classname> objname;


    e.g. whatsapp group(class)

        member :(data member)

        admin: (object) -  object can add - remove members

        messaging - video calling - (membr function or methods)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
__init__() : init function which is represent as a magic method or dunder method 
    (double underscore method)

    __init__ which is represented as a constructor in class

    which is invoke automatically whenever we create object of  class

self : self is a parameter which is represented current class properties.


==================================================================

difference beetween function and methods



function which is represent by def keyword and methods are represente by def keywords


function are independent , and methods are dependent


function which define outside the class


methods which is defined inside the class


============================================================
3) inheritance : one class derive propertiers of another class its called inheritance
     inheritance provide reusablity of code

    using of inheritance we can reduce our code


    we can save developement time


    there is 5 type of inheritance :

    1) single 
    2) multiple 
    3)multilevel
    4)hirarchical
    5)hybrid

    ----------------------------------------------------
    1)single inheritance:
            class A
            |
            V 
            class B 

            class A is super class ,base class or parent class.

    2)multilvel inheritance
            class A 
            |
            V 
            class B 
            |
            V 
            class C
    3) multiple inheritance
    two different class inherited by single class
      class A                         class B 
      |                                 |
      ----------------------------------
                    |
                    V 
                    class C 

    4) hierarchical inheritance 
     one parent classd have mote than one child class

                     Class A 
                      | 
        ---------------------------------
        |                              |
        class B                      class C
    5) hybrid inheritance :
            combination of hierarchical and multiple inheritance
            Class A 
                      | 
        ---------------------------------
        |                              |
        class B                      class C
        |
        V 
        class D
========================================================================
encapsulation: Encapsulation is similiar like capsule which wrap diffrent diffrent type of data in single entity.


    using encapsulation we can prevent dayta from outside the uses.

    there is 2 thing s involves with encapsulation
    1)getter and setter method
    2)prevent data (private-public)

===========================================================================
"""data hiding """
using of encaposulation we can hide or prevent data from outside the class.

there are 3 visiblity modes

1)public
2)private
3)protectede public 


1)public: by defaulkt all data member and member function are public
we can acess from anywhere from the class and outside teh class

eg.  name 
    SUBJECT 

2) PRIVATE: this kind of data member and me function can only access by class which is restricated by outside class.
        this is use for data hiding and prevent data from outside the class

        eg. __name 
            __subject

3) protected: this is only acess by own class and subclass but this is not working 100% as a data hiding

eg.  _name
    _subject
