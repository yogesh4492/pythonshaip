"""Polymorphism"""

polymorphism: poly means many and morphism means forms
        polymorphism is derived from greek word which means one named 
        method has different different forms

        polymorphism contain 2 methods

        1)method overloading : compile time polymorphism
        2)method overloading : run time polymorphism

        ----------------------------------------------------
        1)method overloading :
                when one class contaiin same name methods with different forms,parameter its called method overloading

               in python method overloading which is not supported
        2)method overriding :
               when parent and child both have same name method its called method overrra ding.

ABC: Abstraction : Abstract Base class
        Abstraction which is represented only few information not allocated background information.

        for data hiding purpose we use abstarction.

        abstract class which is contain only method declaration without method definition.
