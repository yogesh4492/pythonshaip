there are 2 types of exception are there

1) built-in exception 
    -> there are many exceptions which is provided by python

    e.g.    valueError
            ZeroDivisionError
            NameError
            KeyError
            IndexError

2) userdefined exceptions:
    when we want to stop execution flow as per our requirement 
    when we want to add our exception error in program.

    when we want to stop program at strong validation time.

    syntax:
    class AgeException(Exception):
        pass
