Exception: due to some unwanted event or action coding flow distrub this called exception
to handle this kind of Exception its called Exception Handling.

in python using of try and except block we can handle exception
--------------------------------------------------------------
one program can contain as many as exception in one code

syntax:

try:
    code
except type1:
    statement 
except type2:
    statement 
except type3:
    statement 
----------------------------------------
else : else block always ececute when there is no exception in program.

syntax:
try:
    error code
except type:
    statement

    result
---------------------------------------------------------
finally : finally block always call when there is any exception occur or not .
syntax:
try:
    error code
except type:
    statement
else:
    result 
finally:
    closing message

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
there are 2 types of exception are there

1) built-in exception 
    -> there are many exceptions which is provided by python

    e.g.    valueError
            ZeroDivisionError
            NameError
            KeyError
            IndexError

2) userdefined exceptions:
    when we want to stop execution flow as per our requirement 
    when we want to add our exception error in program.

    when we want to stop program at strong validation time.

    syntax:
    class AgeException(Exception):
        pass
